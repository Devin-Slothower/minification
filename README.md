**Minification** is a lightweight, open-source project dedicated to shrinking your code footprint. With minification, you can say goodbye to bloated files.

**What is Minification?**

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters and formatting from your code without affecting its functionality. This includes:

* **Whitespace:** Eliminate extra spaces, tabs, and newlines.
* **Comments:** Strip out debugging and explanatory comments.
* **Variable Names:** Shorten variable names (with user-defined options for clarity).
* **Redundant Code:** Identify and remove unused code paths and duplicate expressions.
* **Language-Specific Optimizations:** Leverage specialized strategies for each supported language to further compact the code.

**Why Minification?**

The benefits of minified code are numerous:

* **Reduced File Size:** Smaller files mean faster downloads, quicker page loads, and improved bandwidth efficiency.
* **Enhanced Performance:** Optimized code can in certain use cases execute faster, leading to smoother user experiences and reduced server load.
* **Improved Readability (Optional):** Minification can also generate optimized, comment-less versions alongside the original code for maintainability purposes.

**Supported Languages:**

Currently, Minification libraries are available for these popular languages:

* **Lua:**

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Minify repository:** `git clone https://github.com/devin-slothower/minification.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** Refer to the language-specific instructions in the docs (soon).
3. **Minify your code:** Use the provided library or executable in your desired language.
4. **Enjoy the benefits:** Witness the smaller size, faster execution, and improved performance of your applications.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you'd like to add support for new languages, suggest optimization techniques, or improve the documentation, we're happy to have you on board.
